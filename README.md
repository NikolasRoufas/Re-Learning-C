# Re-Learning-C Data Structures and Algorithms

Improvements
- Pass the array as const in findMax
- Since findMax does not modify the array, marking it as const improves code safety.
- Add Edge Case Handling
- Ensure findMax does not operate on an empty array (though your tests already avoid this).
- Better Formatting and Readability
- Use consistent spacing for readability.
